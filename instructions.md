# Instructions to run App

Using npm or yarn execute the command `npm i`/`yarn` to load the dependencies.

I have been using the LTS version of Node `12.8.2`.

You will need two terminal windows/tabs, one to run the server with the command `npm run server`/`yarn server`.  
With the other tab you will need to start the app with `npm run watch`/`yarn watch`.

The app needs a good review and some refactoring.

One feature I didn't get to was creating a search feature and currently the search bar is only for looks.
I had some fun going back to work with some basics.  
Enjoy!
