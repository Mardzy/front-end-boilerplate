# Instructions to run App

Using npm or yarn execute the command `npm i`/`yarn` to load the dependencies.

The development branch is can be pulled from the `develop` branch and is the branch you will need to use if you want to run locally. 
The master branch is deployed to `https://mardzy.github.io/front-end-boilerplate/dist/`. With the master branch you will still need to run the proxy server to have the website function

You will need two terminal windows/tabs, one to run the server with the command `npm run server`/`yarn server`.  
With the other tab you will need to start the app with `npm run watch`/`yarn watch`.

The app needs a good review and some refactoring.

One feature I didn't get to  add error handling for the search bar.
I had some fun going back to work with some basics.  
Enjoy!
